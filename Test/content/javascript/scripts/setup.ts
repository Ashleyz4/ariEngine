// This makes the Visual Studio Code app initialize TypeScript
// This also works in Atom if you have the Atom-TypeScript package (kind of, not really)
//  - Atom might be broken because it can't find ../tsconfig.json (sorry)
// I do this because of error testing. Would you rather look for each and every function yourself?
// As an alternative:
//  - var classes = Engine.getMethodsOfClass(object);
//  - var super = Engine.getSuperClassOfClass(object);

Console.warn("entry point");
//Console.
