### Using this?
#### Download the repo, compile it yourself using mvn package, then create modifications using content/javascript/scripts/yourFile.ts

###### All TypeScript files you have in your scripts folder should contain a reference to TS at the top for syntax error checking:
```javascript
/// <reference path='../index.d.ts'/>
```
###### I will create a wiki source for this soon explaining how TypeScript works for JS.
